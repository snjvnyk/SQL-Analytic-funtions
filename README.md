# Analyzing Population Data in Google BigQuery using SQL

This project focuses on practicing SQL queries with the census_bureau_usa.population_by_zip_2010 dataset available in Google BigQuery. This public dataset contains population information by ZIP code from the US Census Bureau.

**Objectives**:
- Retrieve total population and demographic information by ZIP codes.
- Analyze gender-based population distribution within a given ZIP code.
- Identify age groups with the highest population for both genders.
- Extract demographic insights, such as the age group with the highest male and female populations within a ZIP code.

This project is solely for practice purposes, aiming to practice rank() functions in SQL and BigQuery
